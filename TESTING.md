# Best Practices for Manual Testing

When testing a web project manually, there are a few best practices you should follow to ensure that you're doing a thorough and effective job. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

## 1. Use Incognito Mode

It's important to test the web project in a clean browser environment that's not influenced by cookies, extensions, or other factors that could affect the test results. Using Incognito Mode provides a fresh browser session for each test, which is perfect for this.

## 2. Start from the Login Flow

Start by testing the login flow. This ensures you're testing the full functionality of the application, and if the login flow is broken or has issues, it could affect other parts of the application. Therefore, it's important to test it thoroughly.

## 3. Test Form Validations

Form validations are an important part of any web application. Test your forms with different data types, including valid and invalid inputs, to ensure that the validations are working correctly. Here are some sub-points on how to test form validations:

- Test required fields to ensure they can't be submitted empty.
- Test the minimum and maximum length of input fields.
- Test special characters to ensure that they're not allowed in certain fields, such as passwords.
- Test for data type validation, such as ensuring that an email input field only accepts a valid email address format.

## 4. Test Data Validation

Datas validation are more important that form validations. Every data must be checked before passing it the backend or database

## 5. Test Navigation and Links

Test all the links and navigation elements in the web project, including menu items, buttons, and hyperlinks. This helps identify broken links or navigation issues that could affect the user experience.

## 6. Test Error Messages

When testing a web project, test the error messages displayed to the user. This includes error messages for invalid inputs, server errors, and other issues. Ensure that the error messages are clear and informative, and that they provide helpful guidance on how to resolve the issue.

## 7. Use Test Data

It's important to use test data when testing a web project, rather than real user data. This ensures that real user data remains confidential and unaffected by testing. Make sure that the test data covers a range of scenarios and edge cases.
